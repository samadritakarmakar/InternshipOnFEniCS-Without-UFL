### This is a Fork of the fenics-solid-mechanics library. The aim of the project is to extend the existing library such that it is applicable to more kinds of Plasticity models. 

FEniCS (https://fenicsproject.org/) is an open-source (LGPLv3) computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). FEniCS enables users to quickly translate scientific models into efficient finite element code.  

One of the FEniCS applications is the fenics-solid-mechanics library (https://bitbucket.org/fenics-apps/fenics-solid-mechanics/src/master/). The current source code has been forked is being actively modified to accommodate more kinds of Plasticity Models.  

One such model that is being aimed to be added to this library is the Sinfonietta classica (Nova 1988). It is a model for soils and soft rocks.  

Later on, this library may be further extended to apply an extension of Sinfonietta classica model developed by Quentin Rousseau (quentin.rousseau AT ec-nantes.fr)and Guilio Sciarra (giulio.sciarra AT ec-nantes.fr) of GeM - Institut de Recherche en Genie Civil et Mecanique.
